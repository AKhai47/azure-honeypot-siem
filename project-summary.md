# ðŸ“˜ Project Summary

This project simulates a real-world security operations use case in the cloud. I deployed an Azure-hosted honeypot VM, enabled full inbound access, and monitored failed login attempts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Simulate brute-force attacks using a purposely exposed VM
- Collect Windows security logs into a central log repository
- Enrich logs with location data using IP-to-geo watchlists
- Visualize attacks on a live map using Sentinel Workbooks

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Cloud network exposure & firewall misconfiguration simulation
- Central log collection and SIEM integration
- KQL log analysis
- Threat visualization with geolocation
